**Note:** I set the color for the menu section after hovering. After reviewing the Figma file, I felt unsure and adjusted the background color again at home. However, I kept the background color consistent for all menu items, even when hovering.

## Design Responsiveness

Everything looks fine on the laptop screen and is perfect on mobile as well. There were no scroll issues; during testing, a scroll appeared once, but after zooming in and out and resetting the browser zoom, it disappeared. Currently, the design is only responsive for phones. After receiving the marks, I will also make it responsive for tablets.

## Training and Exercise Section

Since there were no marks in the training and exercise section, I created on my own way. I tried to replicate the Figma file, but I encountered some difficulties, so I didnâ€™t spend too much time on that.

## Challenge Instructions

Additionally, as part of the challenge, I made sure to follow all the provided instructions correctly, including getting the BMI calculator to work properly. There was also an instruction to add a section based on my own idea, so I included a testimonial section for that.

Thank you!
