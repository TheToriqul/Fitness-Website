Note: Ensure to test on both large (desktop) and small (mobile) devices for each browser.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize images for web to reduce load times, especially for mobile devices.
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files for production.
- Consider lazy loading images for improved performance on slower connections, particularly on mobile devices.

## Testing

Manually test the website on various large (desktop) and small (mobile) devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality. Focus on:

1. Desktop/large device views
2. Mobile/small device views
3. Functionality of interactive elements on both device types

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section
3. Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Select the root folder as the source
5. Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site
6. After deployment, test on both large (desktop) and small (mobile) devices

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a fully functional BMI calculator using JavaScript.
- Add a blog section for fitness tips and articles.
- Integrate a workout scheduling system.
- Develop a mobile app version of the website.
- Consider developing a tablet-specific layout if needed in the future.
